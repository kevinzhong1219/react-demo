React tool, testing, and development

Please see notes at:

In this project, I take my non-profit's landing page as example to showcase the process of CI/CD for react. The existing project uses **Next.js 15** (App Router), and language is TypeScript.

Implementation:
Stage1: static code analysis with SonarQube

Stage2: Testing

Stage3: Build and package into docker
Stage4: Push to registry
Stage5: Push to cloud (Kubernates)
